## Blockchain - Concept 1 - Hashing

* Hash functions are mathematical functions that transform or **map** a given set of 
data into a bit string of fixed size, also known as the **hash value**.

* Typically, cryptographic hash functions are utilized as opposed to normal hash functions because of certain additional 
security properties which make them difficult to compute and easy to verify. 

## Blockchain - Concept 2 - Merkle tree

* Merkle tree is a tree data structure where each leaf nodes are a single transaction. 
* This is useful when discarding spent transactions because only the root included in the block's hash.
* Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree.
